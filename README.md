# Machine Learning Lab Experiments

Welcome to the Machine Learning Lab! This repository contains a collection of experiments, code samples, and notes related to machine learning concepts and practical implementations.

## Contents

- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and data splitting.
- **Regression Models**: Implementation of Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression.
- **Classification Models**: Examples include Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest.
- **Clustering**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering examples.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA, LDA, and Kernel PCA.
- **Model Selection & Evaluation**: Techniques such as cross-validation, grid search, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **Deep Learning**: Basics and demos using neural networks (if included).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hubsukalp/Machine-Learning_Lab.git
   cd Machine-Learning_Lab
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   Most scripts use Python 3 and standard libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`.  
   You can install requirements using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   (Create `requirements.txt` if missing by listing required libraries.)

3. **Explore experiments:**  
   Each experiment is documented in its respective folder or file. Read the instructions at the top of each script for dataset requirements and usage.
